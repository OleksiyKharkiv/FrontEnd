## Project Overview

This is my personal **web CV** which is meant to showcase my backend development skills. It includes links to relevant projects and resources that I have worked on, as well as a demonstration of active links (HTML5) to enrich the navigation experience.

The website layout includes an easy-to-read structure, clean navigation, and is designed with an emphasis on accessibility and usability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To build the structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page and making the links active (blue color when clicked).
- **JavaScript**: Optional (if used for more advanced features, can be added for dynamic content).

## Features

- **Active Links**: All links on the site turn blue when clicked.
- **Clean and Simple Design**: The layout is designed to be straightforward and easy to navigate.
- **Mobile Responsive**: The site is designed to work seamlessly across devices.
